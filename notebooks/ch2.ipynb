    "In this chapter, we will continue to analyze the gene expression data from Chapter 1, but with a slightly different purpose: we want to use each patient's *gene expression profile* (the full vector of their gene expression measurements) to predict their expected survival.\n",
    "In order to use full profiles, we need a stronger normalization than what Chapter 1's RPKM provides.\n",
    "We will instead perform [*quantile normalization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_normalization), a technique that ensures measurements fit a specific distribution.\n",
    "This method enforces a strong assumption: if the data are not distributed according to a desired shape, we just make it fit!\n",
    "This might feel a bit like cheating, but it turns out to be simple and useful in many cases where the specific distribution doesn't matter, but the relative changes of values within a population are important.\n",

    "4. Arrays underpin the scientific Python ecosystem. The `scipy.stats.rankdata` function operates not on Python lists, but on NumPy arrays. This is true of many scientific libraries in Python.\n",
