    "It uses the `DataFrame` type, which is a flexible tabular format based on the data frame object in R.\n",
    "For example, the data we will read has a column of gene names (strings) and multiple columns of counts (integers), so reading it into a homogeneous array of numbers would be the wrong approach.\n",
    "Although NumPy has some support for mixed data types (called \"structured arrays\"), it is not primarily designed for\n",
    "this use case, which makes subsequent operations harder than they need to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reading the data in as a pandas data frame, we can let pandas do all the parsing, then extract out the relevant information and store it in a more efficient data type.\n",
    "Here we are just using pandas briefly to import data.\n",
    "In later chapters we will see a bit more of pandas, but for details, read *Python\n",
